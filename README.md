# NCBounds

*Note:* NCBounds is no longer actively maintained.

NCBounds is a Python module able to compute worst-case performances upper bounds in the Network Calculus framework. 

## Hypothesis: 
- rate-latency servers;
- token-bucket arrival curves.

## Computations:
- Exact bounds for tree networks;
- Decomposition into trees to compute upper bounds in general networks;
- SFA (separated flow analysis) also implemented.

## Installation:
``` sudo python3 ./setup.py install```
